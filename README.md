## Sample Queries

| Natural Language Input                  | SQL Translation                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List all departments                    | `SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;`                                                      |
| Top 5 products by sales in 2023         | `SELECT TOP 5 product_name, SUM(sales) FROM orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023 GROUP BY product_name ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC;` |
| Average salary by department            | `SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;`                              |
| Show total revenue per year             | `SELECT YEAR(order_date), SUM(revenue) FROM sales GROUP BY YEAR(order_date);`                     |

## Prompting Tips

- **Be specific:** Include table or column names when possible.
- **Use filters:** e.g., "Employees with salary over 70000 in Marketing."
- **Avoid vague phrasing:** General inputs like "Show me something interesting" may not yield usable results.

---

## Limitations

- May struggle with vague or highly contextual queries.
- Only read operations are permitted (no updates/deletes).
- SQL errors are caught and shown gracefully, but complex queries may require refinement.
- Sensitive data masking is not yet implemented.

## Reflections

See [REFLECTIONS.txt](./REFLECTIONS.txt) for a detailed write-up.

**Summary:**
- GenAI (GPT-4) can accurately translate natural language to SQL, especially when grounded with schema and context.
- Prompt engineering and schema-awareness are essential for reliable results.
- Robust error handling and a clean UI are key for user trust and adoption.
